# Group-Project Chicken Jockey
Our plan currently is to create a game with a variety of enemies and weapons the player can use to kill the enemies. The player will be in an arena that we are making battling enemies each round, at the end of each round the player will be able to go into a store and buy armor, health, upgraded stats, and weapons. Outside of the store there is a button that you push in order to move the game to the next round. As rounds progress more enemies and more different enemies spawn in.

Rather than having a round time limit, or a certain number of enemies to kill per round, there will be a total "health pool" and killing any kind of enemy takes away from the total pool. When the HP pool reaches zero, the next round starts.

Currently planning for 5 main enemy types with different AI for each, as well as boss/elite variants with better stats.


* Park: Camera, main character guy
* Aidan: Weapons, enemies
* Liam: Store, calculating balanced enemy scaling
* Bryan: Weapons, enemies, shaders
* Roger: UI, hud
